                    <li>I'm grateful to be an organizer for
                        <a href="https://columbiaintech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Columbia in Tech</a>, a community of Columbia alumni working in technology.</li>
                    <li>I've interned at three MBA student-run ventures at
                        <a href="https://columbiabuildlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Columbia Build Lab</a>, an incubator housed at Columbia Business School.
                        I served as undergraduate co-president of the program for nearly two years. I led brand and marketing, recruitment, and served as point of contact for all participants. During my time, the program expanded significantly,
                        and I'm really proud of what we accomplished.

                    <li>During college, I worked on research at Teachers College and Columbia University
                        Irving Medical Center and have learned a lot about knowledge diversity
                        and structural variant gene annotation, respectively.</li>
