                    <li>I'm grateful to be an organizer for
                        <a href="https://columbiaintech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Columbia in Tech</a>, a community of Columbia alumni working in technology.</li>
                    <li>I've interned at three MBA student-run ventures at
                        <a href="https://columbiabuildlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Columbia Build Lab</a>, an incubator housed at Columbia Business School.
                        I served as undergraduate co-president of the program for nearly two years. I led brand and marketing, recruitment, and served as point-of-contact for all participants. During my time, the program expanded significantly,
                        and I'm really proud of what we accomplished.
                    </li>
                    <li>During college, I assisted on research at Teachers College, where I learned a lot about cooperative learning and knowledge diversity, and Columbia University
                        Irving Medical Center, where I worked on genome annotation to identify novel structural variants in populations with pediatric hearing loss.
